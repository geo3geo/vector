Competitive Vector 
==================
Simple example of operating two Vectors in parallel processing routines
Each vector does 'pressups' with random delays between so they don't finish together.
Hopefully others will develope this to produce more elaborate
gaming scripts for two (or more!) Vectors


Line-Following Vector 
=======================
Basically it analyses the video camera feed by converting it to lines, and then working out angle and offset from centre. Vector's direction of travel is then adjusted by angle and offset.
It's been structured for possible future expansion to have two vectors going at the same time using multiprocessing.
Good lighting is required for this, and reflections off the base can upset things. But it's a start!

I didn't want to write this code, my Vectors made me do it as they were getting bored being in lockdown.
